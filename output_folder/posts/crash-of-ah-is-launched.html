    <p>After fixed a critical Bug on iOS 6. My iOS hilarious voice control game Crash of Ah was launched. It has a very simple mechanical to play. You shout “Ah” to control the Ah’s spaceship and dodge the stone pillars like Flappy Bird. It’s full of fun especially play with friends.</p>

<p>This game made by my own. In the first I decided to finished the game in 2 weeks, but I finished the game over 2 months. In the develop time I found I could improve every part of my game, like program functional, graphics and sound effects, and I enjoy it. So I decided to make the game as better as possible. It’s the main cause of the delay.</p>

<h3>Main features:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Background music(or noise…).</li>
<li>Encryption mechanical to protect graphic resources. It’s order to prevent the copycat from copy the game into another platform.</li>
<li>Encryption Game Center score saving mechanical to protect the offline score. It’s prevent the score cheater from replacing the offline score file.</li>
<li>I drawn all graphics on a Wacom tablet.</li>
<li>Game promote web pages.</li>
<li>Game promote video.</li>
<li>If you haven’t try this little game, you must check it out on App store.</li>
</ul>
